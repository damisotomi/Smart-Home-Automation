# Gesture-Controlled Smart Home Automation System

This project implements a Gesture-Controlled Smart Home System using computer vision techniques. Hand gestures are detected in real-time with OpenCV and MediaPipe, enabling intuitive control of household devices via Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
Features

    Recognizes specific hand gestures for controlling lights, fans, doors, and more.
    Utilizes Raspberry Pi for gesture detection and Arduino for device control.
    Detailed documentation provided for easy replication and understanding.
    Seamless communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

## Getting Started

    Clone this repository.
    Follow the documentation to set up the system.
    Run the provided code to experience gesture-controlled automation.
